# --- General Settings ---
# Sets the timezone for the container, affecting cron scheduling and log timestamps.
TZ=America/Los_Angeles

# The maximum total number of items to search for across ALL instances in a single run.
# This acts as a global cap. Set to 0 to disable all searches. A negative value means no global limit.
MAX_UPGRADES=20

# DRY_RUN is enabled by default for safety. This runs the script in a simulation mode.
# It will log what would be searched for without actually sending any search commands.
# Set to "false" after verifying your configuration is working as expected.
DRY_RUN=true

# The number of seconds to wait between triggering searches for each instance.
# This helps to stagger the load on indexers and download clients.
DELAY_BETWEEN_INSTANCES=10

# The number of days to wait before an item can be searched for again.
# This prevents the script from repeatedly searching for the same media.
HISTORY_COOLDOWN_DAYS=30

# --- Debugging Settings ---
# Set to "true" to enable debug mode. This will save detailed lists of all processed media
# and their upgrade eligibility to JSON files in the config directory (e.g., radarr_debug_list.json).
# This is useful for troubleshooting why certain items are or are not being searched.
