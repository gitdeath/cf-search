# .env file - Example Configuration for Multi-Instance Setup

# --- General Settings ---
# Sets the timezone for the container, affecting cron scheduling and log timestamps.
TZ=America/Los_Angeles

# --- Scheduling ---
# You can use CRON_SCHEDULE for full control (e.g., "0 2 * * *")
# OR use SEARCH_INTERVAL for simplified scheduling (e.g., "1m", "3h", "2d").
# CRON_SCHEDULE takes precedence if both are set.
# SEARCH_INTERVAL=3h

# The maximum total number of items to search for across ALL instances in a single run.
# This acts as a global cap. Set to 0 to disable all searches. A negative value means no global limit.
MAX_UPGRADES=20

# DRY_RUN is enabled by default for safety. This runs the script in a simulation mode.
# It will log what would be searched for without actually sending any search commands.
# Set to "false" after verifying your configuration is working as expected.
DRY_RUN=true

# The number of seconds to wait between triggering searches for each instance.
# This helps to stagger the load on indexers and download clients.
DELAY_BETWEEN_INSTANCES=10

# The number of days to wait before an item can be searched for again.
# This prevents the script from repeatedly searching for the same media.
HISTORY_COOLDOWN_DAYS=30

# --- Debugging Settings ---
# Set to "true" to enable debug mode. This will save detailed lists of all processed media
# and their upgrade eligibility to JSON files in the config directory (e.g., radarr_debug_list.json).
# This is useful for troubleshooting why certain items are or are not being searched.
DEBUG_MODE=false

# --- Radarr Instance 0 (Main Radarr) ---
# URL for the Radarr instance (no trailing slash).
RADARR0_URL="http://192.168.0.100:7878"
# API Key for this Radarr instance.
RADARR0_API_KEY="your_radarr0_api_key_here"
# The max number of movies to search for from THIS instance that have not met their quality cutoff.
# Defaults to 0 if not set (opt-in). Set to 0 to disable this type of search. A negative number means no limit.
RADARR0_NUM_CUTOFF_UNMET_TO_UPGRADE=5
# The max number of movies to search for from THIS instance based on Custom Format score.
# Defaults to unlimited if not set. Set to 0 to disable this type of search.
RADARR0_NUM_TO_UPGRADE=5
# The maximum number of items allowed in the queue before skipping searches for this instance.
# If the queue size is greater than or equal to this limit, the instance is skipped.
# RADARR0_QUEUE_SIZE_LIMIT=100

# --- Radarr Instance 1 (Optional Example, e.g., 4K Radarr) ---
# To add more instances, increment the number (e.g., RADARR1, RADARR2, etc.).
# RADARR1_URL="http://192.168.0.101:7878"
# RADARR1_API_KEY="your_radarr1_api_key_here"

# --- Sonarr Instance 0 (Main Sonarr) ---
# URL for the Sonarr instance (no trailing slash).
SONARR0_URL="http://192.168.0.100:8989"
# API Key for this Sonarr instance.
SONARR0_API_KEY="your_sonarr0_api_key_here"
# The max number of episodes to search for from THIS instance that have not met their quality cutoff.
# Defaults to 0 if not set (opt-in). Set to 0 to disable this type of search. A negative number means no limit.
SONARR0_NUM_CUTOFF_UNMET_TO_UPGRADE=5
# The max number of episodes to search for from THIS instance based on Custom Format score.
# Defaults to unlimited if not set. Set to 0 to disable this type of search.

# The maximum number of items allowed in the queue before skipping searches for this instance.
# If the queue size is greater than or equal to this limit, the instance is skipped.
# SONARR0_QUEUE_SIZE_LIMIT=100
# Search mode: "episode" (default) or "season".
# "season" mode groups upgradeable episodes by season and triggers a SeasonSearch.
# SONARR0_SEARCH_MODE=season

# --- Sonarr Instance 1 (Optional Example, e.g., Anime Sonarr) ---
# SONARR1_URL="http://192.168.0.102:8989"
